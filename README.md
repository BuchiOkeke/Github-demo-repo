# My first Personal Github Project.
I call this project a personal github project because I am learning python as a beginner. 
On this journey of learning python, I have been practing simple codes with the hopes to climb higher as I continue to learn. 
# ----------------------
This Project is basically a compilation of different python topics that I have practiced by writing codes related to them e.g List, Variables, Datatypes.
